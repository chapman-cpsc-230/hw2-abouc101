## Description

I had to make 2 different programs, one that calculated a math formula, and another which calculated how fast a cup of tea would cool down given the room temperature.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to better utilize "while" loops to make even more complicated programs.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
